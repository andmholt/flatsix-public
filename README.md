Flatsix is a multifaceted musician ear-training MERN app serving as a combination between modern social media and ear training in a real-time online multiplayer environment. Currently still under development, many features are polished and working.

*Although the repository code currently supports login functionality, this functionality has not yet been extended to the live demo in order to expose as much functionality of the app as possible*
