Flatsix is a multifaceted musician ear-training MERN app serving as a combination between modern social media and ear training in a real-time online multiplayer environment. Currently still under development, many features are polished and working.

A live demo can be accessed [here](https://flatsix.herokuapp.com/).
> *Since many features of this app require the user to be logged in, the demo has been heavily adjusted from the repository code so that no log-ins are required.*
